/**
 * The single env variable ARCA uses to tell a launched shell which startup
 * features its wrapper should turn on, plus the pure selection that fills it.
 *
 * Why a positive allowlist the wrapper destroys before anything else runs:
 * every earlier switch was a negative, exported one (`ORCA_SHELL_READY_MARKER=0`,
 * `ORCA_SHELL_COMMAND_MARKERS=0`). Those live in the pane's PTY env, so every
 * child inherits them — a pane launched with a feature suppressed suppressed it
 * for an ARCA started from that pane too. With an allowlist, an inherited or
 * stale value can only ever mean *fewer* features, never more, and the wrapper
 * unsets it before the user's own config (or anything it spawns) can see it.
